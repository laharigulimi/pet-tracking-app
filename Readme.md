Alternatively, these end-points can be tested from postman
- To test your API endpoints using Postman, follow these steps:

  - Testing the /api/pets/cat Endpoint (POST)
     Steps:
     - Open Postman and create a new request.
     - Set the request method to POST.
     - Enter the request URL:{{base_url}}/api/pets/cat. Example:  http://localhost:8080/api/pets/cat.
     - Set the headers:
       - Key: Content-Type
